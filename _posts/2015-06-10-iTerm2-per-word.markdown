I have not used iTerm in a long time but decided to give it another shot due to the whole splitting of 'panes' like this:

I quickly found the "Option + arrow" navigation was not working for me. After some [ddging](http://ddg.gg) i found i needed to add a "Send Escape Sequence" for each. Option + L-Arrow (Esc+ B) and Option + R-Arrow (Esc+ f):
